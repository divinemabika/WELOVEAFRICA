          <p>Education is our passport to the future…We believe that with given the right education, the right chances, the right development every man,
             woman and child has a unique gift that needs to be brought out.  We understand the unique needs of each community as well as being able to see the bigger picture.</p>
             <p>We are familiar with how the children fit into the bigger picture and how they are linked to the change of their community. We spend an umpteen amount of time with the communities and work with them to understand the needs
            and to work to come up with effective solutions to combat social exclusions and challenges faced.</p>
            <p><strong>Our main focus: Education, Well-being and empowerment.</strong></p>
            <p>For us our education enterprise is our passport towards a better future and one that can combat the inequalities and injustice. Not only do we provide schools fees for those who can’t afford to go to school,
            we also help build and refurbish classrooms, provide better space for learning as well as assist in
            training workshops which include: teacher training, management skills for adults, entrepreneurships and emprise.</p>
            <p>Everyday children are actively learning and being engaged, and we believe that in providing a safe space, children can spend their time and learn.</p>
