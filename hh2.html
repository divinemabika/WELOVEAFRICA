                   <p>At I Heart Africa we believe in empowerment.</p>
<p>We recognise the importance of developing the untapped potential dormant in every child. We pride ourselves in understanding the unique needs of each child, as well as being able to see the bigger picture. This extends to being familiar with how the child ties into the fabric of their local community. We spend quality time with the communities that we work with, in order to truly know them and work with them to derive an effective solution to the challenges they face.</p>
<p>The streams that we focus on are namely: Education, Health and Well-being.</p>
<p>For us, our Education Initiative is the lifeline between poverty and self-determination. Not only do we provide school fees for orphans in order to keep them in classrooms, we also facilitate training workshops on a range of subjects and at varying levels. Topics include: Management skills for adults; Entrepreneurship and Enterprise; Nutrition.</p>

                 <p>Because children are actively learning every second of the day, we are firm believers in ensuring that the settings in which children spend their time are stimulating and safe. Thus, Orphanage-Infrastructure- Strengthening, falls under our Education Initiative.</p>
<p>Our ambitious Health Project once completed will be a crucial centre for a community of 27,000 people. One of our founders is passionate about reforming healthcare systems by way of grassroots organisation. So, what better way than to embark on a dynamic project in a vibrant and over populated Ngaba. We cannot know that they lack the basic necessities and do nothing. We cannot know that visiting this hospital makes people sicker than they started out, and simply look away.</p>
<p>Our Well-being Initiative is a holistic approach to well-being that engages and combines the physical, mental and emotional dimensions of each person. Through sports and nutrition we encourage children and young people to be the best versions of themselves. We empower them to take charge of their lives by first acknowledging the potential that lies within and subsequently taking steps to cultivate this potential.</p>
